# Android Push Notifications â€¢ Flutter x Firebase
This project integrates Android push notifications into a Flutter app using Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). It leverages the following packages:

firebase_core: For Firebase initialization in the Flutter app.
firebase_messaging: For handling push notifications from Firebase Cloud Messaging.
Key Features:
Notification Permission: The user is prompted to grant notification permissions upon app launch.
Receive Notifications: Users will receive notifications even when the app is closed or running in the background.
Navigation on Notification Click: When the user clicks on a notification, the app navigates directly to a screen that displays the notification's message.
This setup ensures seamless delivery and interaction with push notifications in the Flutter application.
